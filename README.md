# The Chess bot

This repo is the source code for the chess-bot project of [MCEN90028 - Robotics System](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/subjects/mcen90028) at the University of Melbourne.

### Overview
The project mainly focuses on design a serial manipulator to pick and drop a chess piece on the board from scratch with given tool kit. The tool kit includes 4 SCS15 servo motors and 2 SCS009 servo motors with an Arduino Mega board. In order to achieve the objectives of the project, we tried to achieve different sub-goals over the course through Assignment 1 to 5. The stages can be presented as
1. Obtain the symbolic representation for Forward and Inverse Kinematics of the robot arm (Assignment 1).
2. From there, we studied the relation of task space velocity and torque wrench on the end-effector (gripper) (Assignment 2).
3. Then, we generate the trajectory for the end-effector in 3D space with respect to time (Assignment 3).
4. The CAD model needs to be ready at this stage for fabrication and testing (Final Report).
5. Calibrate the robot arm to minimise the error in operation (Final Report).
